# 🎙️ LiveLingo — Real-Time Voice Translation for Windows

**LiveLingo** turns your speech into another language **live**, on a virtual
microphone — so Microsoft Teams (or Zoom, Discord, Google Meet, OBS…) hears the
translation as if it were your mic. Speak **French**, others hear **English**
(both languages configurable).

```text
🎤 mic (French)
   └─► Whisper STT  (speech → French text: Groq cloud large-v3, or local)
        └─► translation (French → English: Google free, or Groq LLM for quality)
             └─► edge-tts  (English text → speech, free)
                  └─► VB-Cable  ──►  "CABLE Output" used as mic in Teams
```

Translation and text-to-speech use free public services (internet required).
Speech-to-text runs **either** on Groq's free cloud Whisper (most accurate,
recommended) **or** fully locally with faster-whisper (offline).

## 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| **Windows 10/11** | The tool uses Windows audio APIs (MME via PortAudio). |
| **Python 3.10+** | 3.10 – 3.12 recommended. Check with `python --version`. |
| **VB-CABLE** | Free virtual audio cable. Download: **https://vb-audio.com/Cable/** |
| **Internet** | Needed for translation + TTS (and the first Whisper model download). |

### Install VB-CABLE

1. Download the VB-CABLE zip from <https://vb-audio.com/Cable/>.
2. Extract it, then **right-click `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` → Run as administrator**.
3. Click **Install Driver**.
4. **Reboot Windows** (important — the device won't appear reliably until you do).

After reboot you will have two new devices:

- **CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)** — a *playback* device. **This tool sends the English speech here.**
- **CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)** — a *recording* device. **Teams selects this as its microphone.**

---

## 2. Installation

From this project folder:

```powershell
# (optional but recommended) create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> When using the **local** STT engine, the first run downloads the Whisper model
> (`small` ≈ 0.5 GB, `medium` ≈ 1.5 GB) into `~/.cache/huggingface` — automatic,
> just wait once. With the **Groq** engine (recommended), no download is needed.

---

## 3. Find your device indices

```powershell
python list_devices.py
```

This prints every audio device with its **index**, marking inputs (green),
outputs (magenta), and the VB-Cable device. Example:

```
idx   in out  host API       name
  1    2   0  MME            Microphone (Realtek Audio)      <- default-in
  8    0   2  MME            CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)   <- VB-CABLE
 12    0   2  MME            Speakers (Realtek Audio)        <- default-out
```

Note the index of **your microphone** and of **CABLE Input**.

---

## 4. Configure

You can leave the defaults (mic = system default, output = `CABLE Input`) and it
will usually just work. To customise, either edit [`config.py`](config.py)
directly, or copy the example env file:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
notepad .env
```

Common settings:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `SOURCE_LANG` | `fr` | Language you speak |
| `TARGET_LANG` | `en` | Language others hear |
| `STT_ENGINE` | `auto` | `auto`/`groq`/`local` — Groq cloud Whisper (best) vs local (see below) |
| `GROQ_STT_MODEL` | `whisper-large-v3` | Groq STT model (`whisper-large-v3-turbo` = faster) |
| `STT_INITIAL_PROMPT` | *(empty)* | Hint of names/vocabulary/accents to bias recognition |
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `small` | Local model: `tiny`/`base`/`small`/`medium`/`large-v3`/`large-v3-turbo` |
| `INPUT_DEVICE` | *(default mic)* | Mic index or name substring |
| `OUTPUT_DEVICE` | `CABLE Input` | VB-Cable playback device (index or name) |
| `TTS_VOICE` | `en-US-AriaNeural` | Edge voice for **target** — locale must match `TARGET_LANG` (see below) |
| `TTS_VOICE_ALT` | *(auto on swap)* | Voice for the other language in the pair; used by terminal `[g]` swap |
| `CHUNK_DURATION` | `4.0` | Target/fixed chunk length (seconds) |
| `VAD_ENABLED` | `true` | Split on pauses (true) vs fixed chunks (false) |
| `SILENCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.015` | Mic loudness threshold for speech detection |
| `MONITOR_PLAYBACK` | `false` | Also play the translation on your speakers (testing) |
| `MONITOR_DEVICE` | *(default out)* | Device for the monitor copy (index/name) |
| `MUTE_CAPTURE_DURING_PLAYBACK` | `true` | Pause STT capture while TTS plays (breaks speaker→mic loop) |
| `MUTE_CAPTURE_HANGOVER_MS` | `350` | Wait (ms) after TTS before reopening the mic |
| `TRANSLATION_ENGINE` | `auto` | `auto`/`llm`/`google` (see below) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | Free Groq key → much better translation quality |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Groq model (`llama-3.1-8b-instant` = faster) |

### Elegant Edge voices (quick reference)

Set in `.env`: `TTS_VOICE=exact-name`. The voice **locale prefix must match `TARGET_LANG`**
(`en` → `en-*`, `es` → `es-*`, `fr` → `fr-*`). Wrong locale → correct text, wrong accent.

**List every available voice** (Microsoft Edge neural TTS):

```powershell
edge-tts --list-voices
```

Filter EN / ES / FR (PowerShell):

```powershell
edge-tts --list-voices | Select-String "en-US|en-GB|es-ES|es-MX|fr-FR"
```

Linux / WSL / macOS:

```bash
edge-tts --list-voices | grep -E "en-US|en-GB|es-ES|es-MX|fr-FR"
```

Curated **polite / professional** picks for meetings — 2 male + 2 female per language:

| Language | Gender | `TTS_VOICE` | Profile |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **English** (`en`) | Female | `en-US-AriaNeural` | Clear, professional (US) — classic default |
| **English** (`en`) | Female | `en-GB-SoniaNeural` | Polished British, formal tone |
| **English** (`en`) | Male | `en-GB-RyanNeural` | Sober British, executive meeting |
| **English** (`en`) | Male | `en-US-ChristopherNeural` | Calm, articulate American |
| **Spanish** (`es`) | Female | `es-ES-ElviraNeural` | Spain, clean formal diction |
| **Spanish** (`es`) | Female | `es-MX-DaliaNeural` | Mexico, natural and polite |
| **Spanish** (`es`) | Male | `es-ES-AlvaroNeural` | Spain, deep professional |
| **Spanish** (`es`) | Male | `es-MX-JorgeNeural` | Mexico, confident and sober |
| **French** (`fr`) | Female | `fr-FR-DeniseNeural` | France, elegant and neutral |
| **French** (`fr`) | Female | `fr-FR-EloiseNeural` | France, clear and cordial |
| **French** (`fr`) | Male | `fr-FR-HenriNeural` | France, formal and measured |
| **French** (`fr`) | Male | `fr-FR-AlainNeural` | France, mature and polite |

Example `.env` (EN → FR, elegant male voice):

```env
SOURCE_LANG=en
TARGET_LANG=fr
TTS_VOICE=fr-FR-HenriNeural
```

> `*MultilingualNeural` voices can read several languages but **keep the accent of their
> locale**. Prefer `fr-FR-*` for native French, `es-ES-*` / `es-MX-*` for Spanish, etc.

**Runtime language swap:** press **`g`** in the terminal menu to invert `SOURCE_LANG` ↔
`TARGET_LANG` (STT + translation + TTS voice). The menu shows a bright yellow line such as
`[g]  Swap idiomas   EN → PT`. Set `TTS_VOICE` for the current target and `TTS_VOICE_ALT`
for the other side (or leave alt empty for an automatic elegant default). Old history
chunks are **not** re-translated.

### Better transcription accuracy (recommended, free)

If you speak but the *wrong words* come out, the local `small` model is usually
the culprit. The biggest, free fix is to let **Groq transcribe in the cloud**
with `whisper-large-v3` — far more accurate (especially for non-English speech),
fast, and it offloads your CPU.

1. Set a free `GROQ_API_KEY` (same key as for translation — see below).
2. Leave `STT_ENGINE=auto` (the default). With a key present it automatically
   uses Groq; without one it stays fully local. You'll see
   `Speech-to-text ready (Groq cloud / whisper-large-v3)` on startup.

Other knobs:

- **Stay offline?** Set `STT_ENGINE=local` and raise the local model:
  `WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3-turbo` (much more accurate than `small`, still
  reasonable on CPU) or `medium`.
- **Wrong names/jargon?** Set `STT_INITIAL_PROMPT` to a sentence containing the
  expected vocabulary, names and accents — it biases both engines.

> If the Groq key/network fails at startup, LiveLingo automatically falls back
> to the local Whisper model so it always works.

### Better translation quality (optional, free LLM)

By default the tool uses Google Translate. For **far more natural** results
(the "Typeless" effect — an LLM cleans up the raw speech-to-text *and*
translates it in one step), plug in a **free Groq API key**:

1. Go to **https://console.groq.com/keys** → sign up (no credit card).
2. Create a key (starts with `gsk_…`) and copy it.
3. Put it in your `.env`:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
   ```
4. Run `python main.py` — you'll see `LLM translation ready (Groq / …)` plus a
   quick self-test. With `TRANSLATION_ENGINE=auto`, the LLM is used whenever a
   key is present, otherwise it falls back to Google.

> Privacy note: with the Groq STT engine, your **audio** is sent to Groq for
> transcription; with the LLM engine, the recognized **text** is sent for
> translation. To keep audio fully local, set `STT_ENGINE=local`. Without a key,
> STT runs locally and only Google Translate is used.

---

## 5. Run it

```powershell
python main.py
```

### Dev auto-reload

LiveLingo is a long-running CLI: **Python does not hot-reload** source on save
(unlike Flask/FastAPI `--reload`).

```powershell
python dev_reload.py
python dev_reload.py -v
```

**Must** start via `dev_reload.py` (not bare `python main.py`). Uses content
hashes (WSL `/mnt/c` safe). Restarts `main.py` on `.py` save; session state is
lost each time. Stop with **Ctrl+C** on the watcher terminal.

You'll see a banner, the detected/selected devices, and then a live status line
per chunk:

```
[chunk 3] Heard: "bonjour tout le monde" -> Translated: "hello everyone"
          ⏱  STT 1.20s | translate 0.30s | TTS 0.55s | total 2.05s
```

Stop any time with **Ctrl+C**.

### TUI (default)

With `UI_MODE=tui` (default) you get a Textual UI: **two log tabs**, command field, fixed listen header (robot + language pair + audio), and a full-width command menu. Footer labels follow `SOURCE_LANG`. Set `UI_MODE=classic` for the legacy print/readline UI.

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| **Tradução** | Heard/Translated phrase blocks + command output |
| **Sistema** | Pipeline stages, VAD/listen lines, timings, debug, **F1** help |

| Shortcut / command | Action |
|--------------------|--------|
| `F1` | Startup help → **Sistema** tab (opens that tab) |
| `F3` | Toggle Tradução ↔ Sistema |
| `F4` / `u` | Compact UI: hide command menu; keep command line (optional window height shrink) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy selected log text |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `F2` | Copy entire log (active tab) |
| Palette → Screenshot | Save SVG+PNG under `.cache/screenshots/` and put the **image** on the clipboard |
| `↑` / `↓` | Command history |
| `g` | Swap SOURCE ↔ TARGET |
| `t` / `t EN` | Change TARGET only (codes forced UPPERCASE) |
| `enew <text>` | New translation from typed text (no mic); TTS if sound ON |
| `e` / `eN` | Edit last / chunk N (TUI pre-fills the sentence in the command field) |
| `b` / `bypass` | **Voice bypass** — raw mic → CABLE (Teams) without translation; press again to resume translate |
| `gg` / `GG` (or `gt` / `gf`) | Go top / go bottom of the **active** log tab. `GG` is case-sensitive. |
| `cls` | Clear both log panels |
| `l` / `lo` / `lt` | List session / source-only / target-only |
| `co` / `coN` / `codN` | Comment on a chunk / delete comment by id |
| `s` / `n` / `r` / `rN` | Sound, mic mute, replay |
| `a` / `aN` / `p` / `pN` | Copy audio path / open audio folder |
| `ld` | List audio devices (`python list_devices.py`) into the log |
| `lav` | List all edge-tts voices (`edge-tts --list-voices`) into the log |
| `lv` | List filtered voices (`en-US|en-GB|es-ES|es-MX|fr-FR`) into the log |
| `ctts <ShortName>` | Change `TTS_VOICE` (one-liner or prompt; no modal) |
| `q` | Quit |

### Faster per-phrase text (sentence split)

With **sound OFF** (default), a short pause after enough speech can emit a **sentence-sized chunk** immediately (STT + translate + UI) without waiting for the whole monologue. Configure in `.env`:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `SENTENCE_SPLIT` | `true` | Early emit on short pauses |
| `SENTENCE_SPLIT_SOUND_OFF_ONLY` | `true` | Only when audio is OFF (safer with live TTS) |
| `SENTENCE_SILENCE` | `0.55` | Pause (s) treated as end-of-sentence |
| `SENTENCE_MIN_SPEECH` | `1.0` | Min speech (s) before a split |
| `SENTENCE_SPLIT_OVERLAP` | `0.25` | Overlap kept after a split |

For lower end-of-turn wait, also lower `SILENCE_DURATION` / `SOUND_OFF_SILENCE_DURATION` (e.g. `0.7`–`0.8`).

Resume a session without the picker:

```powershell
python main.py <session_id>
# or
livelingo <session_id>
```

### Use it as your microphone in Microsoft Teams / Google Meet

**LiveLingo `.env` (example):** `INPUT_DEVICE=<your mic>` · `OUTPUT_DEVICE=CABLE Input` (or its index, e.g. `19`).

| Role | Device |
|------|--------|
| You speak | Real microphone (e.g. USB headset) |
| LiveLingo plays translation | **CABLE Input** (`OUTPUT_DEVICE`) |
| Teams / Meet mic | **CABLE Output** |
| You hear others | Your speakers/headphones (app speaker setting) |

1. Keep `main.py` running; press **`s`** if you want live translation audio on the cable.
2. **Teams:** Settings → Devices → Microphone = **CABLE Output**; Speakers = your headset.
3. **Google Meet (browser):** ⋯ → Settings → Audio → same mic/speaker choices; allow the site to use the mic.
4. Speak in `SOURCE_LANG` → participants hear `TARGET_LANG`.

> **You do not hear your own CABLE feed in Teams/Meet by default** (no mic sidetone). The CABLE Output **level meter** moving means audio is entering the call. To hear the translation yourself: `MONITOR_PLAYBACK=true` + `MONITOR_DEVICE=<speakers>`, or Windows 11 *Sound settings → More sound settings → Recording → CABLE Output → Properties → Listen → Listen to this device*.

**Speak English (or any language) without translation:** press **`b`** (bypass) — raw mic goes to CABLE; press **`b`** again to resume translate.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

**"VB-Cable was not found" / it exits immediately.**
Install VB-CABLE (section 1) and **reboot**. Re-run `python list_devices.py` to
confirm "CABLE Input" appears. If you renamed it, set `OUTPUT_DEVICE` to its
index.

**Teams doesn't pick up any audio.**
Make sure Teams' microphone is **CABLE Output** (the *Output* one), not CABLE
Input. Also confirm `main.py` is actually producing chunks (status lines appear).

**Short words get cut off / it never sends a chunk.**
Adjust VAD: lower `SILENCE_THRESHOLD` (e.g. `0.008`) if your mic is quiet, or
shorten `SILENCE_DURATION`. If background noise constantly triggers it, raise
`SILENCE_THRESHOLD`. You can also set `VAD_ENABLED=false` for fixed 4-second
chunks.

**Whisper hallucinates phrases during silence** (e.g. random subtitles).
Keep `WHISPER_VAD_FILTER=true` (default) and raise `SILENCE_THRESHOLD` a bit so
silent chunks aren't sent.

**I say words but the wrong words come out** (poor accuracy).
The local `small` model is usually the cause. Best fix: set a free `GROQ_API_KEY`
and keep `STT_ENGINE=auto` to transcribe with Groq's `whisper-large-v3`. To stay
offline, raise the local model (`WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3-turbo`). See "Better
transcription accuracy" above.

**It's too slow / chunks pile up** (`processing is N chunks behind`).
Use `STT_ENGINE=groq` to offload transcription to the cloud, or a smaller local
model: `WHISPER_MODEL=base` or `tiny`. Set `WHISPER_BEAM_SIZE=1` for extra speed.

**`Could not decode TTS audio` / soundfile MP3 error.**
Ensure `soundfile>=0.12.1` is installed (`pip install -U soundfile`); older
versions can't decode the MP3 that edge-tts returns.

**TTS fails with `403, Invalid response status`.**
Microsoft's TTS endpoint requires a time-based token (`Sec-MS-GEC`) that older
edge-tts versions can't generate. Fix: `pip install --upgrade edge-tts` (use
7.x or newer). Also make sure your **system clock is correct** — the token is
time-based, so a clock off by more than a few minutes also causes 403.

**Translation/TTS errors about network.**
deep-translator and edge-tts need internet. Check connectivity / proxy /
firewall. Transient failures skip a single chunk and the tool keeps running.

**Wrong microphone is captured.**
Set `INPUT_DEVICE` to the correct index from `list_devices.py`.

**GPU acceleration (optional).**
With an NVIDIA GPU + CUDA/cuDNN installed, set `WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda` and
`WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=float16` for much faster STT.

## Notes & limitations

- This is **chunked** near-real-time translation, not simultaneous interpreting:
  there is inherent latency (record an utterance → transcribe → translate →
  speak). Expect ~1–4 s after you finish a sentence.
- Translation and TTS quality depend on the free Google/Edge services.
- Privacy depends on the engines: with `STT_ENGINE=local` your audio never
  leaves the machine (only the recognized text and TTS request do). With the
  Groq STT engine, audio chunks are sent to Groq for transcription.
